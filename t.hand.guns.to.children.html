    <h1><a href="/t">Why You Should Not</a> &rarr; Hand Guns To Children</h1>
    <summary>
      Never give guns to children. They lack the maturity, understanding, and
      emotional capacity to handle weapons safely. They may accidentally harm
      themselves or others due to their lack of judgment. Children may act
      impulsively or recklessly, unable to handle the responsibility of owning a
      gun. They may lack the physical strength and dexterity needed to handle a
      firearm safely. These factors greatly increase the risk of injury or
      death, making it not worth the risk. Wait until they're older and properly
      trained in gun safety before allowing them to handle firearms.
