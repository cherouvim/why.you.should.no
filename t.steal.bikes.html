    <summary>
      Stealing bikes, or any other property, is wrong and is against the law in
      most places. In addition to being illegal, stealing can also have serious
      consequences for the perpetrator, including fines, imprisonment, and a
      criminal record. A criminal record can make it difficult to find
      employment, housing, and other opportunities, and can have long-term
      negative impacts on a person's life. Stealing also causes harm to the
      victim, who may lose property that has sentimental or practical value, and
      may suffer financial or other consequences as a result of the theft.
      Instead of stealing, it is important to respect the property of others and
      to find legal and ethical ways to obtain the things you need or want.
