    <summary>
      Drinking and driving is extremely dangerous and is one of the leading
      causes of preventable deaths worldwide. Alcohol impairs judgment,
      coordination, and reaction time, making it much more difficult to operate
      a vehicle safely. Even a small amount of alcohol can significantly
      increase the risk of a crash, and the risk increases significantly as the
      blood alcohol concentration (BAC) increases. In addition to the risk of
      causing a crash, those who drink and drive also risk being arrested and
      losing their driver's license. It is never acceptable to drink and drive,
      and it is important to find a safe and sober way to get home after
      consuming alcohol. If you have been drinking and need to get somewhere,
      consider using a designated driver, a ride-sharing service, public
      transportation, or a taxi. By making the responsible choice not to drink
      and drive, you can help to keep yourself and others safe on the road.
